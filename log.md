        - Anki
+ In Class: Unix bash, Git, & Github

----------------------------------------------------------

## 30 Mar '22

+ Added 3 Anki cards on methods fundamentals.

+ [JavaScript Design Patterns](https://www.patterns.dev/posts/classic-design-patterns/):

    - [Introduction](https://www.patterns.dev/posts/classic-design-patterns/#introduction)

    - [What is a Pattern?](https://www.patterns.dev/posts/classic-design-patterns/#whatisapattern)

    - ["Pattern"-ity Testing, Proto-Patterns & The Rule Of Three](https://www.patterns.dev/posts/classic-design-patterns/#patternity)

    - [The Structure Of A Design Pattern](https://www.patterns.dev/posts/classic-design-patterns/#designpatternstructure)

    - [Writing Design Patterns](https://www.patterns.dev/posts/classic-design-patterns/#writingdesignpatterns)

    - Though I'm not sure I understand the scope of what a pattern really is. I thought I was going to find something like, when we want to reverse a string we split the string into an array, use the reverse method to reverse the array, then join the reversed array into a reversed version of the string. This seems to be a deeper scope of how to implement different pieces of code in the design of a code base. I will have to keep reading to find out for sure. I do like how this author writes, it reminds me of how Leon explains things.
